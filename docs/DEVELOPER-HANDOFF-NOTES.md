## Core business rules
- Money is stored internally as integer piasters/qirsh.
- Normal UI displays جنيه/`ج.م`, not raw qirsh.
- Minimum sale price is enforced before stock or sale mutation.
- Reference cost is optional.
- Estimated profit and stock valuation are incomplete when reference cost is missing.
- Restore remains limited to an empty system under the current safe design.
